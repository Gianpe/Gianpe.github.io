The original dataset is composed by 776k tweets related
to Joe Biden and 970k to Donald Trump. Each tweet is described by its text and 19 additional
attributes: 4 tweet attributes (timestamp, likes, retweets, source: webapp/mobile),8 user attributes
(nickname, screen name, join date),7 location attributes (country, city, state, latitude, longitude).
To train a model we also have a support dataset, that contains sentences and the sentiment of that
sentence labeled as positive, neutral or negative. The main goal of this work is to create a timeline
visualisation of general twitter community attitude to candidates.
