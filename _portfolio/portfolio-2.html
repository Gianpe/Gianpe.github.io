This text is based on the study of the dataset "Occupancy Detection", available in UCI (machine learning repository) site, composed by three dataset ("datatest.txt", "datatest2.txt" and "datatraining.txt"), using the sci-kit learn library,
pandas, Numpy and Keras. The project objective is that of apply the main
tool we know, in order to extract information from the dataset, to classify new
records, make predictions based on time and detect the pattern rules to un-
derstand the occupational situation of a room. To do so, we have to adapt the
dataset to the task, sometimes modifying it or creating a new one from the orig-
inal. The study could have multiple application, like to avoid waste of energy or
to get better some environmental condition. The work starts with the analysis
of the data, passing through the main classication techniques we know. Also, a
time series analysis was made. The code we implemented to perform the study is
available in our GitHub channel (https://github.com/DM2-project/Occupancy-
detection).
We implemented and evaluated some basic classiers. The performance of all them is good. Below are reported, the weighted average of precision, the recall and F1-score.

Then we implemented and evaluated advanced classifier, they go obviously deeper and are more precise the the basic
ones. Nevertheless, in this case it seem useless to applique these classiers, since
the basic ones were already almost perfect and considering that in some cases,
like the application on NN, the classiers are more time consuming, it doesn't
worth to use them. However, they conrmed the work done and we can arm
we have high precision in classify our data.

We made an analysis of the dataset based on time: we created time series
by transforming the attribute "Date" into our index.  To
make this analysis, we used three different datasets: the original one and two
datasets obtained by selecting random rows from the original one. The latters
have same dimensions.
