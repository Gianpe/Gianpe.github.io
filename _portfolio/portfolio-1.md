I apply this technique to a training set obtained from microarray experiments on oligonucleotides of sick patients of leukemia, in order to group them into the three main categories of the disease. In general, the clustering serves to estimate the classes belonging to the training set with geometric considerations, looking at the distribution and density of data input. The objective of these techniques is therefore to minimize the distance of objects in a group and maximize the distance between different groups. From the moment that the problems of Clustering often have a high number of data there is need of an efficient algorithm. This algorithm is found in algebraic ways and in particular, in spectral clustering, the algorithm is based on the calculation of the second eigenvector of the Laplacian.
