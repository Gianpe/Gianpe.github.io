Hello, my name is Gianmarco Pepi and I am an aspiring data scientist. I have a strong interest in the various ways in which data can be used to gain insights and make predictions in various fields such as sports, medicine, and politics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Bioengineering from the University of Pisa and I am currently finishing my Master's degree in Data Science.

I have experience using programming languages such as Python, Matlab and R, and am proficient in data scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. I also have experience with distributed data analysis using PySpark and am familiar with data structures and algorithms. I am also familiar with visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, and data management tools like MongoDB, SQL Server Management Studio, and Neo4j.

In my free time, I have worked as a freelancer on Upwork and have taken courses in Neo4j for data science and Artificial Intelligence Academy. In my portfolio, you will find a summary of the projects I have worked on such as my Master's Thesis on Spectral Clustering on microarray, Bioinformatics projects, NLP project and Data mining projects, Distributed Data Analysis, and Social Network Analysis.

I have also had the opportunity to gain practical experience as a Data Scientist Intern at Wind Tre and as a Junior Data Scientist at Topnetwork. I am excited to continue learning and growing in the field of data science and I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for any data-related position.
